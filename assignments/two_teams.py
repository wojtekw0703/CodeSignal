There are some students standing in a row, each has some number written on their back.
The students are about to divide into two teams by counting off by twos: those standing 
at the even positions (0-based) will go to team A, and those standing at the odd position will join the team B.

Your task is to calculate the difference between the sums of numbers written on the backs of the 
students that will join team A, and those written on the backs of the students that will join team B.

    return sum(students[::2]) - sum(students[1::2])
